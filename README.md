# MineHunter

MineHunter is a practical cryptomining traffic detection algorithm based on time series tracking. Instead of being deployed at the hosts, MineHunter detects the cryptomining traffic at the entrance of enterprise or campus networks. Minehunter has taken into account the challenges faced by the actual deployment environment, including extremely unbalanced datasets, controllable alarms, traffic confusion, and efficiency.
